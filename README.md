## Description

This the repo for all the info regarding ["Haskell Programming from First Principles"][haskellbook] reading group organized by the [Budapest Haskell User Group][bphug].  
If you want to join us sign up [form][form], how many people are intersted, and what are their preferences. We also got a discount coupon from the authors, which we only can send if you fill out the form.

The group agreed to meet once a month. This is not set in stone, so if the group decides that in the future a more frequent gathering would be better we can change it.

We will continually update the group's progress here, so even those people can follow with us, who can't come every time. We'll also gather here all the usefull links, and information that came up during the discussions.

You can follow our progress on the repo's [project page][project].

If you want to continue the discussion, or have problems with the assignments, create an issue on this repo, so we can disuss it here.

## Our Progress

* **2016-09-14**: We held the first, [kick-off meeting][kickoff]. We assigned the first 4 chapters (big chapters, to and including pg. 134) to be read until the next meeting (~~which will be around the middle of October, we will post the date shortly~~).

* **2016-10-13**: We held our first proper gathering and discussed the first four chapters. The next assignment is from Chapters 5 (Types) through 8 (Recursion). The final date for the meetup will be posted on the [group's site][bphug].

## Useful links

*   The authors of the book have a great [write-up][install] about installing Haskell (the book's code is compatible with GHC 7.8 through 8, but we recommend you use min. 7.10.3 for the group).
*   Bartosz Milewski has great, accessible writings on his [website][bartosz] about the more theoretical aspects of functional programming.
*   [Hoogle][hoogle] is a API search engine for Haskell.
*   [Hackage][hackage] lets you search, and browse Haskell packages, and their documentation.
