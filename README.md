## Description
This the repo for all the info regarding ["Haskell Programming from First Principles"][haskellbook] reading group organized by the [Budapest Haskell User Group][bphug].  
If you want to join us sign up [form][form], how many people are intersted, and what are their preferences. We also got a discount coupon from the authors, which we only can send if you fill out the form.

The group agreed to meet once a month. This is not set in stone, so if the group decides that in the future a more frequent gathering would be better we can change it.

We will continually update the group's progress here, so even those people can follow with us, who can't come every time. We'll also gather here all the usefull links, and information that came up during the discussions.

If you want to continue the discussion, or have problems with the assignments, create an issue on this repo, so we can disuss it here.

## Our Progress
* **2016-09-14**: We held the first, [kick-off meeting][kickoff]. We assigned the first 4 chapters (big chapters, to and including pg. 134) to be read until the next meeting (which will be around the middle of October, we will post the date shortly).

## Useful links
* The authors of the book have a great [write-up][install] about installing Haskell (we recommend min. 7.10.3 for the group).
*   Bartosz Milewski has great, accessible writings on his [website][bartosz] about the more theoretical aspects of functional programming.
